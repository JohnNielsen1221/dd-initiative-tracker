## General Info
This program will allow the Dungeon Master to set up the players and the monsters with their respective stats enabling better tracking during the campaign. After the cards are created, the Dungeon Master is able to drag the needed players/monsters into the battle column when they are needed in battle. You are also able to randomly create a unique name for each created monster.

## Functionality
 - Clicking the 'Add Player" button will generate a modal containing a form where you are able to input all the information needed for that given player. After form is coomoplete, clicking the "Submit" button will generate a card will all the information that was just input.
 - You can enter any monster name in the D&D catalog and click 'Add Monster' to generate a card with information about that monster.
 - Both the Player and Monster Cards will append to the bottom of the column, allowing you to create as many cards as needed.
 - Inside the cards, you can hover over each respective button to enable the 'Tooltips' function, showing the information assigned to that button.
 - Also inside the card, the starting HP is populated into an input field, allowing the DM to update the HP throughout the compaign.
 - As the campaign progresses and battles happen, the DM is able to drag the associated player/monster cards into the battle column in the order that the initiative is set (manually done with dice by the players).
 - The DM is able to generate a unique monster name with the 'Name Generator' at the bottom of the page just by clicking the 'Generate a Name' button. They can then copy and paste that name onto the Monster Card.
